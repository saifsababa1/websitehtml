      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <h3>Senior Web Designer</h3>
<p> As a Junior Backend Developer, I was responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic that powers dynamic web applications. I collaborated closely with a team of developers to design efficient, scalable, and secure backend services that ensure seamless communication between users and the application. My day-to-day tasks involved developing and testing RESTful APIs, optimizing database queries, and managing schema structures to improve data handling. I also worked on troubleshooting and debugging issues, enhancing application performance and reliability. Through this role, I gained hands-on experience with Python (or Java/Node.js), SQL databases, and tools like Git and Docker, all while adhering to agile methodologies to meet project goals effectively.</p>     
      <h3> Junior Backend Developer</h3>
<p> As a Junior Frontend Developer, I focused on creating visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly interfaces. My role involved translating design wireframes into interactive, cross-browser-compatible web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working with frameworks like React (or Vue.js/Angular), I built reusable components and implemented best practices to enhance website performance and accessibility. I collaborated closely with UI/UX designers to ensure an intuitive and accessible user experience, optimizing layout for various devices. My experience also included using Git for version control and participating in code reviews, allowing me to improve my coding skills and contribute effectively to a cohesive team.</p>    </section>

This passion for discovery extends beyond tech; I’m also an avid musician who loves playing both classical and oriental music.

Whether it’s coding or playing an instrument, I thrive on the process of learning and creating.
